#PROJECT
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Malting Time-course metabolomics study
PR:PROJECT_TYPE                  	Untargeted LC-MS and GC-MS analysis
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Malting, a crucial process for beer production, involves complex biochemical
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	transformations affecting sensory attributes and product quality. Limited
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	knowledge of metabolic alterations during malting hinders the ability to enhance
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	malt quality. This study uses untargeted GC-MS and LC-MS metabolite profiling to
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	characterize metabolic dynamics through the malting process. After data
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	processing, a total of 4980 known metabolites were identified across six stages:
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	dry seed, post-steeping, germination (DOG1, DOG3, DOG5), and kilned, about 82%
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	of these showed significant changes during malting. Statistical analysis
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	revealed stage-dependent shifts in metabolite profiles, highlighting the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	importance of the first 3 days of germination and kilning in determining the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	final metabolite content of finished malt. Dynamic changes in chemical classes
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	and metabolic pathways provided insights into processes critical for malt
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	quality and beer production. Additionally, metabolites associated with
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	antimicrobial properties and stress responses were identified, underscoring the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	interplay between barley and microbial metabolic processes during malting. This
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	comprehensive profiling advances our understanding of malting and suggests
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	potential markers for process monitoring and quality control, ultimately
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	enhancing malt quality and beer production.

SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	(IPA)/acetonitrile (ACN)/water (v/v/v) for 6 min at 4Â°C. After centrifugation,
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	the supernatant was aliquoted into two equal portions and dried. One aliquot was
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	derivatized with methoxamine, a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs)
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	ranging from C08 to C30 was added to each sample, and finally derivatized with
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MSTFA). The prepared samples were
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	then transferred to vials, sealed, and loaded into the GC-MS instrument. Quality
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	control (QC) samples were prepared by equally pooling ground powder from all
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	biological samples and were processed as described above. Method blanks were
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	prepared using the same 3:3:2 IPA/ACN/water mixture without the addition of
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	biological sample and processed using the same extraction and processing
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	procedures as the other samples. Preparation of samples for LC-MS analysis
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Finely ground samples (100-130mg) were extracted with 800 Î¼l of 80% IPA in
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	water for 10 minutes at room temperature. After centrifugation, 700 Î¼l of the
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	supernatant was transferred to a fresh vial. This process was repeated with
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	another 700 Âµl of 80% IPA, and the resulting 1.4 ml of combined supernatant was
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	discarded. The pellet was re-extracted twice more using 700 Âµl of 80% methanol.
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	The 1.4 ml of combined methanol extract was dried under nitrogen and then
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	reconstituted in 100 Âµl of methanol. The reconstituted extracts were then
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	transferred to autosampler vials for UPLC-MS analysis. QCs were prepared by
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	equally pooling ground powder from all samples and were processed as described
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	above. Method blanks were prepared and processed in the same manner without the
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	addition of biological sample.
